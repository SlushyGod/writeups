# TODO

- Need to grab the README.md files to render those to HTML
- Use the README.md file to grab Challenge name and build out a json file that will be used for filtering
- need all the other files to be moved to s3 files, then link these files to buckets (easy to just add to the json)
- need a simple GUI that will just display the markdown, and other information
